To do:
* Experiment with title screen animations
* Find some better sound effects

Turn end sequence:
1. Message shows, matched coins explode
2. Remaining outer coins & center coin refresh
3. New coins randomly come in
4. "Start" message is displayed

* Game notification idea
    1. Fade in a horizontal bar across the screen
    2. Slide notification in from the left, pause at center, slide out
    3. Fade horizontal bar out
    4. Notification method can take an array of strings, so when one message has finished animating, others will display
    4. Also let notification method take a callback, so certain actions can be executed when messages are finished being displayed

Stats:
* Average turn length
* Average break length
* # of coins used
* win/loss ratio

Ideas
* Add achievements?
* Add an "exp" meter? w/ corresponding achievements for gained levels? If that's the case, hardest difficulty should give lots of exp.
* Add a "score" component as well? Time taken/round + quota gained

exp levels?
