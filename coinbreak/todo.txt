To do:
* Experiment with title screen animations
* Fix coin graphics to have equal spacing
* Find some better sound effects

* Game notification idea
    1. Fade in a horizontal bar across the screen
    2. Slide notification in from the left, pause at center, slide out
    3. Fade horizontal bar out
    4. Notification method can take an array of strings, so when one message has finished animating, others will display
    4. Also let notification method take a callback, so certain actions can be executed when messages are finished being displayed

Stats:
* Average turn length
* Average break length
* # of coins used
* win/loss ratio

Ideas
* Add achievements?
* Add an "exp" meter? w/ corresponding achievements for gained levels? If that's the case, hardest difficulty should give lots of exp.
* Add a "score" component as well? Time taken/round + quota gained
